<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>
This policy applies to the use of Address Machine. It was created on June 8th, 2013 and last updated on June 20th, 2013. We update it periodically. Previous versions are <a href="https://github.com/addressmachine/addressmachine/commits/master/src/webroot/privacy.html">available on GitHub</a>.
</p>

<h3>Information you register with us</h3>

<p><br />Address Machine allows you to share Bitcoin addresses and connect them with your email address or Twitter handle.
The point of this service is that <b>anyone who knows your email address or Twitter handle can freely lookup up the Bitcoin addresses you associate with it.</b> This may be done directly using our website or via a service run by a third-party using our API.</p>

<p>We do explicitly not provide a service in the other direction, to allow people who know a Bitcoin address but do not know who it may belong to to look up the corresponding email address or Twitter handle. Our database stores email addresses and Twitter handles only as (unsalted) hashes, so we are unable to reliably produce this information ourselves, apart from where it appears in log files (see below). However, once someone who knows your email address has used our service, we cannot practically prevent them from publishing the data they retrieve more widely. Also, since many email addresses and Twitter handles follow reasonably predictable patterns, it is likely that a determined person could recover may of the email addresses and Twitter handles in our database using the publicly-available API, and even more easily if they were able to get access to the full database.</p>

<p>To make the data you share with us as useful as possible and give people confidence that they can rely on the ability to use it, <b>we may share the full database with other people who are interested in publishing it</b>. If we do this, we will publicize who we are sharing it with.</p>

<p>You can delete your data from our database at any time using a similar process to the one used to create it. Note that if you lose the ability to send from an email address or Twitter handle, you will not be able to delete data attached to that email address or Twitter handle from our database. Also note that once data has been queried or shared, other people may still have copies of your data, even if it we have deleted it from our database.</p>

<p>Except as specified below we will not track or share information about who has queried our database, even with the people whose data is being queried.</p>



<h3>Log Files and Cookies</h3>

<p><br />When you visit our site we store standard web logging data including IP addresses, browser type, referring pages, operating system used and date/time stamps. This information does not identify individual users; it is used only for site administration and analysis of website usage and trends.</p>

<p>When you register or delete a Bitcoin address with us, we keep temporary logs of the necessary email and Twitter transactions. Logs will also be kept by with other services we rely on, over which we do not have any control. At time of writing, these include but, are not limited to, Google for incoming email, SendGrid for outgoing email and Twitter for tweets.</p>

<p>We do not use cookies.</p>


<h3>Security and Accuracy</h3>

<p><br /><b>Address Machine is provided free of charge with ABSOLUTELY NO GUARANTEE OF ACCURACY. We take reasonable efforts to prevent people from tampering with it, but we cannot and do not guarantee that information we provide to you will be correct.</b></p>

<p><b>You should not send substantial amounts of Bitcoins to an address provided by or through Address Machine without confirming the address independently.</b></p>

<p>When we confirm the addition of a Bitcoin address for an email address or Twitter handle, we sign the resulting data with our GPG key. Checking this data will allow you to confirm that it has not been subject to some kinds of tampering, although it will not rule out all possible methods of getting false or inaccurate information in our database. We except no liability for any loss incurred through the use of our systems or software, whether directly or through a third-party, or arising from the use of data signed with our key.</p> 


<p>We will make reasonable efforts to avoid allowing unauthorized third-parties to get access to your data, but we do not guarantee that your data will be 100% secure.</p>


<h3>Judicial proceedings and requests from law enforcement</h3>

<p><br />We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order or legal process served on us. If we are required to disclose information to law enforcement authorities, we will publicize the fact that we have done so if legally permitted.</p>

<p>Note that as our database itself is public, the core data we provide - mappings of email addresses or Twitter handles to Bitcoin addresses - is already available to anyone who is interested in it, with no need to contact us, notify us or undertake legal proceedings.</p>
