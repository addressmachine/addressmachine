Goals:
 - Make it as easy as practical for many different services to prompt people to send money to other people by their email addresses or Twitter handles.
 - Reduce the need for services to hold money on behalf of their users by allowing them to send the money directly.
 - Give people using our service to run their own service a reasonable expectation that in the event that our service goes away, they'll be able to continue operating their service using another provider.
 - Provide users with as much privacy as is practical given the other goals.
 - Hold as little money ourselves as is practical given the other goals.

Functions (Those marked with "x" have not been implemented yet):
 o Web action to get an address for an identifier (email / twitter handle), or say if there isn't one.
 x Web action to get an address for an identifier (email / twitter handle), or create one if there isn't one already.
 o API call to get an address for a an identifier (email / twitter handle), or return a 404 if there isn't one already.
 x API call to get an address for a an identifier (email / twitter handle), or create one if there isn't one already.
 o Register an address from email
 o Unregister an address from email
 o Opt out from email [currently relies on SendGrid]
 o Register an address from twitter
 o Unregister an address from twitter
 x Opt out from twitter [TODO]
 x Collect money for email [TODO]
 x Collect money for twitter [TODO]

Fees:
 - We don't mind running this service at a modest loss, which is what we expect short-term. We may charge for additional services in future, and we'll charge fees where we want to discourage or limit behaviour.
 - If you want to make a lot of queries you may want to pay us a fee to help prove you're not spamming us. Initially we will set this up manually.
 - [TODO] If we create an address for you and money is sent to it but it is not collected within 30 days, we will delete the wallet and donate the money to a good cause, which by default will be ourselves. As well as helping fund the service or some other good cause, this should encourage people not to use us like a bank, and reduce the amount of data we keep on people who didn't sign up for our service.

Sharing and interoperability:
 - All code will be open source. (We may make an exception for some code related to spam-prevention, but it will be possible to run the service without it.)
 - Forward lookups of email and twitter addresses will be public (ie no privacy - anyone can check that your email address is real, and what the Bitcoin address for it is).
 - We will sign address-identifier information with a per-service GPG key so that once we've verified it, it can be confirmed even if it is published by another source.
 - We will share the data on an ongoing basis with other people who want to serve it, if they seem reasonably trustworthy and agree to reciprocate. This will be at our discretion, but we hope that there will be at least one, preferably two or three, independent parties sharing this data and making it available through a public API.
 - If other people with methods of confirming ownership of addresses are prepared to share those addresses with us, we will publish it. Ideally they would sign their data with their own per-service GPG key.
 - Users usually don't expect their email addresses to be listed on the web as this can attract spam, so we will try to avoid doing that - ie we will try to only show your email address to people who already have it.
 - We will store identifiers (email, twitter handles etc) as hashes rather than plain text to reduce the amount of information provided if we or someone we share the data with is compromised. A determined attacker will still be able to recover the plain text for many of these, as email addresses and twitter handles are fairly predictable.
 - We will not provide a reverse service to see who owns an address, although this information could conceivably become available if the data leaked, and in many cases it can be brute-forced.

Non-features:
 - Register and unregister addresses for Facebook identities. (We'd love to do this, but we can't see a way to do it consistent with their TOS.)
 - We do not let you log in and add an address via the website. This is partly because it's safer to duplicate the data to other operators if we don't need a login. We may reconsider in future.

Likely future features:
 - Bridge to any other supported public method, eg. if people start putting Bitcoin addresses in DNS TXT records we'll fetch those and serve them.
 - Add other identifiers that we are able to confirm. (The original motivation behind this was to handle OpenSim avatar identities.)
 - Replace holding payments ourselves with a partnership with an online wallet service that we trust not to suddenly go out of business, for which we may charge a referal fee. We can't do this at the moment, because we don't trust anybody in the Bitcoin world who currently holds Bitcoins for you not to suddenly go out of business. (No offence, guys.)
 - Handle other payment methods - could include other coins like LiteCoin or even other systems like PayPal.
 - Handle electrum-style public keys, and issue transaction-specific addresses, like bitaccept.

Existing services with some similar functionality
 - thewalletlist.org manages Bitcoin addresses for email addresses using a login account.
 - coinapult.com looks after money for people, as we do when we don't have email addresses for them yet.
 - bitcointipper.com lets you send money to people on Twitter.

API calls:
  - TODO: List the web API commands.

Commands (Those marked with "x" have not been implemented yet.)

  - By email - all operations send back a confirmation email, which you then reply to:
     o add@addressmachine.com "adfasdfasdfasdfasdf <bitcoin|litecoin|paypal>": Register an address.
     o delete@addressmachine  "adfasdfasdfasdfasdf <bitcoin|litecoin|paypal>": Delete this address and forget about it. 
     x revoke@addressmachine  "adfasdfasdfasdfasdf <bitcoin|litecoin|paypal>": Keep a record that this address is now bad. [TODO]
     x lookup@addressmachine  "email@example.com" <bitcoin|litecoin|paypal>":  Email me an address for @username. [TODO]
     x temp@addressmachine    "email@example.com" <bitcoin|litecoin|paypal>":  Look up an address for @username, or make a temporary one if they don't have one.
     x die@addressmachine.com 

  - Twitter
     o @addressmachine ADD adfasdfasdfasdfasdf <bitcoin|litecoin|paypal>
     o @addressmachine adfasdfasdfasdfasdf - same as "@addressmachine ADD adfasdfasdfasdfasdf bitcoin"
     o @addressmachine DELETE adfasdfasdfasdfasdf <bitcoin|litecoin|paypal>
     x @addressmachine REVOKE adfasdfasdfasdfasdf <bitcoin|litecoin|paypal> - keep a record that this address is now bad. [TODO]
     o @addressmachine LOOKUP @username <bitcoin|litecoin|paypal> tweet me an address for @username
     o @addressmachine @username - a synonym for - @addressmachine LOOKUP @username <bitcoin|litecoin|paypal> 
     x @addressmachine TEMP @username <bitcoin|litecoin|paypal> look up an address for @username, or make a temporary one if they don't have one. [TODO]
     x @addressmachine DIE - delete all my addresses [TODO]
